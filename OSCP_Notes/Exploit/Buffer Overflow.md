As these are my OSCP notes, and there is no longer a buffer overflow machine on the exam, I'm leaving this content out of the guide for brevity. Instead I'll link a resource which turned out to be better and more succinct than the notes I took on the subject when I went through the course. Here is [V1n1v131r4's guide on Buffer Overflows](https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/OSCP-Buffer-Overflow).
