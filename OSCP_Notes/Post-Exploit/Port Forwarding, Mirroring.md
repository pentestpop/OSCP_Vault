### Ligolo
[Guide](https://medium.com/@Thigh_GoD/ligolo-ng-finally-adds-local-port-forwarding-5bf9b19609f9)
**Basic usage**
From Kali:
1. `sudo ip tuntap add user pop mode tun ligolo`
2. `sudo ip link set ligolo up`
3. `sudo ip route add $targetIP.0/24 dev ligolo`
4. `sudo ./proxy -selfcert`

From Windows Target (agent file):
1. `.\ligolo.exe -connect $kaliIP:11601 -ignore-cert`

OR

From Linux Target (agent file):
1. `./ligolo -connect $kaliIP:11601 -ignore-cert`

Then from Kali:
1. `session`
2. `1`
3. `Start`
	1. `listener_add --addr 0.0.0.0:5555 --to 127.0.0.1:6666`
	This allows you to access port 5555 on target from 127.0.0.1:6666 (kali machine). 

 **Local Port Forwarding:**
	- `ip route add 240.0.0.1/32 dev ligolo`
	- **240.0.0.1** will point to whatever machine Ligolo-ng has an active tunnel on.

### Other tools
While the OSCP Lab discusess other tools such as socat, sshuttle, and plink, I found that [Ligolo-ng](https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases) was able to provide all of the same functionality and more simply. That said, I am linking a guide discusess the other tools. Here is frankyyano's [Pivoting & Tunneling guide](https://medium.com/@frankyyano/pivoting-tunneling-for-oscp-and-beyond-33a57dd6dc69). 

### Tips 
Port scanning through a tunnel can take a while, and it may be only TCP scans that work so no UDP or ICMP
